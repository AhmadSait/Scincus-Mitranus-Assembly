The notebook titled Full_Code.ipynb has all the code, the conda installations needed, and the commands to get the evaluations done. The markdown capability of a notebook made it very easy to document everything.

Please just run the cells of the notebook while making sure Synthetic Dataset 1 is in a directory called "synthetic", and Synthetic Dataset 2 is in a directory called "mers". Also, please create a third directory called "outputs" where all output files or directories are stored there.

However, near the end of the notebook, the cells become more like instructions rather than code you can run. This is because due to some commands taking hours to run, I needed to put them in slurm files for them to run while my local machine is off. In these cases, I've highlighted that these commands were run in a terminal by saying "Ran in terminal" at the beginning of the cell.
